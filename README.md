# Liri-Node-App

## Overview
GWU Week 5 First NodeJS assignment. You can find the instructions to this assignment [here.](https://github.com/nrgtwithers/liri-node-app/blob/master/instructions.md)

This app is called LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### How it works
In the terminal, you will be able to pull information from Node-Spotify-API, OMDB API and the Bands In Town API. To be able to pull the information you should use the following commands:

* concert-this
* spotify-this-song
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says

The format you use in the terminal would be node liri.js < command > + < Artist Name / Song Name / Movie Name>
